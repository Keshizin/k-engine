# K-Engine

**K-Engine** is a open source game engine written in C++ developed for my undergraduate thesis in Computer Science (2020).

The main motivation for this project is to study game engine architectures and its technologies, as well as understand other fields of game development and computer science in a deeper way.

Platforms supported:

- Microsoft Windows (Win32)
- Linux (LibX)
- Android (Android NDK)

Graphics API supported:

- OpenGL (WGL, GLX and EGL)

## Building the project

How to build for MSVC:

```
  > cd build/win
  > win-build.bat [Release or Debug]
```

How to build for GCC:

```
  $ cd build/linux
  $ linux-build.sh [Release or Debug]
```
